<h1>About Doge</h1>
<p>Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that started as a joke in 2013, inspired by the popular "Doge" meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog.

It operates on a decentralized network using blockchain technology, similar to Bitcoin, but with faster transaction times and a more lighthearted community. Over the years, Dogecoin has experienced fluctuations in value and popularity, often influenced by social media and endorsements from high-profile individuals like Elon Musk.</p>
